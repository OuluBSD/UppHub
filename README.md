# OuluBSD UppHub Overlay

This is a custom UppHub overlay for OuluBSD related packages.

## Included Packages

- **ConvNetCpp**: C++ implementation of Convolutional Neural Networks (Packages: ConvNet, ConvNetCtrl).
- **Overlook**: A system for monitoring and analyzing data (Package: Overlook).

## Usage

This overlay is **hardcoded** into the OuluBSD fork of TheIDE and umk (available at [github.com/OuluBSD/ai-upp](https://github.com/OuluBSD/ai-upp)). It will be loaded automatically alongside the primary UppHub list.

Alternatively, you can add the raw URL of `nests.json` to your UppHub settings in standard versions of TheIDE or set it in your `upphub_overlay` config for `umk`.
